# PSTAT 131 Final Project
Oftentimes it is difficult to recognize or even understand internal factors of why a certain company has gone bankrupt outside of typical zero profits and negative returns. In the current economy, companies are at the brink of debt as a result of inflation and a variety of other factors. Thus, there has been an increasing demand of business consultation in how to avoid bankruptcy and work around a volatile economy. In this project, I have tasked myself to be a business analyst aiming to help clients determine if their company/business is at risk of bankruptcy based on a variety of given statistics and variables in classification.  I will be providing recommendations, conclusions and speculation for future work in this notebook.

It will be a binary classification denoted by the classes 0 and 1 for surviving bankruptcy and going bankrupt, respectively. Further, determining which aspects that businesses can improve to avoid bankruptcy.
